# NUMERICAL APPROXIMATIONS OF π
## Ian Mitchell, <Ian.Mitchell_001@gmx.com>

**Abstract:** Python has allowed for π to be approximated in many easier ways than before. Using an algorithm where an $n$ number of points are placed and the areas of a square and a circle are compared, π can be approximated to varying degrees of accuracy. However, the algorithm is a very brute-force method, and can heavily use system resources. In general, it would be easier to symbollicaly or numerically solve a Gaussian integral.

**Personal thoughts:** While we haven't been starved for pi approximaters, I think it was time I tried my hand at one. No documentation is really needed since it is more of a paper than a program, that said it really is nothing journal worthy.
